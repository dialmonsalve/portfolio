<p class="leading-7 my-4"> Static page created for Scgroup and its franchise Marble Slab Creamery in Puerto Rico, made 100% with TypeScript and web components in its dynamic parts. It is built as a PWA and is also available in responsive design for mobiles and tablets.</p>

<p class="leading-7 my-4" >The page has 10 routes and is bilingual in both English and Spanish. The banner on the main page is created dynamically, meaning if they decide to add a seasonal image, it will be displayed in an image slider. Currently, it only has one image.</p>
The contact form is made 100% with Astro actions.
